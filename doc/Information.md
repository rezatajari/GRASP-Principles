### **Purpose of the `Information` Class**
The `Information` class is currently a placeholder and does not contain any properties or methods. Its presence suggests it may serve as a conceptual or structural component in the system, potentially acting as a container or base for managing information related to GRASP principles. This class can be extended in the future to encapsulate behaviors or data relevant to the domain.

### **Purpose of the `Book` Class**
The `Book` class represents a domain entity with properties and methods to manage its state. It encapsulates the behavior and data related to a book, such as its name, author, category, and borrowing status. This class demonstrates the following GRASP principles:

1. **Creator Principle**:
   - The `Book` class uses a static factory method (`Create`) to instantiate objects. This ensures that the creation logic is centralized and controlled, adhering to the Creator principle by assigning the responsibility of object creation to the class that has the necessary information.

2. **Information Expert Principle**:
   - The `Book` class encapsulates all the information and behavior related to a book, such as its name, author, category, and borrowing status. It provides methods like `IsAvailable`, `Barrow`, and `Return` to manage and query its state. By doing so, it ensures that the class responsible for managing the data is also the one that owns it.

3. **High Cohesion**:
   - The `Book` class focuses solely on responsibilities related to a book, ensuring high cohesion. It does not take on unrelated responsibilities, which makes the class easier to maintain and extend.

4. **Low Coupling**:
   - The `Book` class is self-contained and does not depend on other classes or external systems. This reduces dependencies and makes the class more modular and reusable.

### **Use Case**
The `Book` class can be used in a library management system to manage the lifecycle of books. For example:
- A new book can be created using the `Create` method.
- The borrowing status of a book can be checked using the `IsAvailable` method.
- A book can be marked as borrowed or returned using the `Barrow` and `Return` methods.

The `Information` class, while currently empty, could be extended to manage metadata or additional details about the library system, such as user information, borrowing history, or system-wide configurations.

### **Impact of Using GRASP Principles**
By applying GRASP principles, the design of the `Book` class achieves:
- **Clarity**: Responsibilities are clearly defined and assigned to the appropriate class.
- **Maintainability**: The class is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
- **Reusability**: The class can be reused in different contexts without modification.
- **Scalability**: The design can be extended to include additional features or integrate with other components without significant changes.

The use of GRASP principles ensures that the system is robust, modular, and adheres to best practices in object-oriented design.
