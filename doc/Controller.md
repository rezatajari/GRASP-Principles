# Documentation: Controller.cs

## Overview
The `Controller.cs` file demonstrates the **Controller** principle from GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns). The Controller principle assigns the responsibility of handling system operations to a class that represents a use-case scenario or a role in the system. This file also highlights the importance of adhering to the **Low Coupling** principle by comparing two implementations of a borrowing controller.

---

## Classes and Interfaces in `Controller.cs`

### **1. Controller**
The `Controller` class is currently a placeholder and does not contain any functionality. It may serve as a conceptual or structural component in the system, potentially to be extended in the future.

---

### **2. BarrowController**
The `BarrowController` class is an example of a controller that violates the **Low Coupling** principle. While it demonstrates the Controller principle by handling the borrowing operation, it directly depends on the `Book` class, which introduces tight coupling.

#### Key Method:
- **`Borrow(Book book, int userId)`**:
  - Checks if the book is available using the `IsAvailable()` method.
  - Marks the book as borrowed using the `Barrow()` method.
  - Outputs a message if the book is not available.
  - Contains logic to associate the book with a user (not fully implemented).

#### Issues:
- **Tight Coupling**: The method directly depends on the `Book` class instead of an abstraction, making it harder to modify or extend.
- **Violation of Low Coupling**: Changes to the `Book` class may require changes to the `BarrowController` class.

---

### **3. ILibraryService (Interface)**
The `ILibraryService` interface defines an abstraction for library services. It ensures that any class implementing this interface provides the following:
- **`BorrowBook(Guid userId, Guid bookId)`**: A method to handle the borrowing of a book by a user.

#### Purpose:
- Promotes **Low Coupling** by allowing the `BorrowBookController` to depend on the abstraction (`ILibraryService`) rather than a specific implementation.

---

### **4. BorrowBookController**
The `BorrowBookController` class is an example of a controller that adheres to both the **Controller** and **Low Coupling** principles. It delegates the borrowing operation to an implementation of the `ILibraryService` interface.

#### Key Properties and Methods:
- **Constructor**:
  - Accepts an `ILibraryService` implementation as a dependency, promoting dependency injection and low coupling.
- **`Borrow(Guid userId, Guid bookId)`**:
  - Delegates the borrowing operation to the `BorrowBook` method of the `ILibraryService` implementation.

#### Benefits:
- **Low Coupling**: The class depends on the `ILibraryService` abstraction rather than a specific implementation.
- **Flexibility**: The class can work with any implementation of `ILibraryService`, making it easier to extend or modify.

## GRASP Principles in `Controller.cs`

### **Controller Principle**
Both `BarrowController` and `BorrowBookController` demonstrate the Controller principle by handling the borrowing operation. However, `BorrowBookController` is a better implementation as it adheres to additional principles like Low Coupling.

### **Low Coupling Principle**
- **BarrowController**: Violates the Low Coupling principle by directly depending on the `Book` class.
- **BorrowBookController**: Adheres to the Low Coupling principle by depending on the `ILibraryService` abstraction.

---

## Use Case
The `Controller.cs` file can be used in a library management system to:
- Handle borrowing operations through controllers.
- Demonstrate the importance of adhering to the Low Coupling principle.
- Provide examples of both good (`BorrowBookController`) and bad (`BarrowController`) implementations of a controller.

---

## Conclusion
The `Controller.cs` file effectively demonstrates the **Controller** principle and highlights the importance of **Low Coupling** in class design. By comparing `BarrowController` and `BorrowBookController`, it emphasizes the benefits of depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This design approach ensures modularity, flexibility, and adherence to GRASP principles.
