# Creator.cs

## Overview
The `Creator.cs` file demonstrates the application of the **Creator** principle from GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns). This principle assigns the responsibility of creating an object to a class that has the necessary information to initialize it or closely uses it.

## Classes in `Creator.cs`

### **1. Creator**
The `Creator` class is currently a placeholder and does not contain any functionality. It may serve as a conceptual or structural component in the system, potentially to be extended in the future.

---

### **2. Library**
The `Library` class is responsible for managing a collection of books. It demonstrates the **Creator** principle by taking responsibility for creating `Book` objects and adding them to its collection.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- **Book Creation**: The `Library` class uses the `Book.Create` factory method to instantiate new `Book` objects.
- **Book Management**: It maintains a private list of books (`List<Book>`) and provides functionality to add books to this collection.

#### Methods:
- **`AddBook(string name, string author, string categoryName)`**:
  - Creates a new `Book` object using the `Book.Create` method.
  - Adds the newly created book to the library's collection.

## GRASP Principle: Creator
The **Creator** principle is applied in the `Library` class. The `Library` class is responsible for creating `Book` objects because:

1. It aggregates `Book` objects in its collection.
2. It has the necessary information (name, author, category) to initialize a `Book`.

By adhering to the Creator principle, the design ensures:
- **Encapsulation**: The creation logic is encapsulated within the `Library` class.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the creation process of `Book` objects are localized to the `Library` class.

---

## Use Case
The `Library` class can be used in a library management system to:
- Add new books to the library's collection.
- Manage and organize books effectively.

The `Creator` class, while currently empty, could be extended to include additional functionality or serve as a base for other components.

---

## Conclusion
The `Creator.cs` file effectively demonstrates the **Creator** principle by assigning the responsibility of creating `Book` objects to the `Library` class. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, encapsulation, and adherence to GRASP principles, making the system modular and maintainable.
